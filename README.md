# Application_Materials

This repository shares my successfull application materials for various fellowships and societies. When I began applying for these, I had no frame of reference for what an application, successful or otherwise, looked like. The goodwill of others who shared their applications publicly or privately with me played a significant role in making my applications successful. I now return that favor by making my application materials publicly available. I hope they help you. If you need any further information, please feel free to reach out to me (e-mail: mam737@cornell.edu, twitter: @ManishaMuna)
